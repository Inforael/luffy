Well, you only need the light when it's

burning low

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you've been high when you're

feeling low

Only hate the road when you're missin' home

Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last

But dreams come slow and they go so fast

You see her when you close your eyes

Maybe one day you'll understand why

Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning

low

Only hate the road when you're missin' home

Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark

Same old empty feeling in your heart

'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast

Well, you see her when you fall asleep

But never to touch and never to keep

'Cause you loved her too much

And you dived too deep
