Hi
    Here´s the return of the points raised.
 
1.	These NA are because those customers can´t deliver that level of granularity (POS)?
   Today we have two different data sources Neogrid and Mtrix, the inventory data sent by Mtrix does not have the POS, so the system always reports the value NA (Does not Apply).
   In the data sent by Neogrid this information is sent and uploaded normally, but when this information is sent blank, the system informs NI (Not Informed).
 
2.	Do you have any reconciliation process in order to include POS data in these customers? (In case that granularity are not a limitation).
   There is no reconciliation process for this field(POS)
 
3.	If we compare the same information column in Sell out we can find some “NI” not NA as we can see in stock data. What difference are between NI and NA.
          NA (Does Not Apply) values reported by the system for the data sent by Mtrix, because the POS information is not sent.
                 NI (Uninformed) values informed by the system for the data sent by Neogrid, when the POS field is Null.
 
tks
